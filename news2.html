            <p>Since its world premiere in 2016, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has been a worldwide hit in London’s West End, on Broadway, in Hamburg, Melbourne, San Francisco and Toronto. For the latest production, which opened at Tokyo’s TBS Akasaka ACT Theatre in July 2023, the show’s Olivier and Tony award-winning sound designer Gareth Fry has trusted a Yamaha RIVAGE PM5 digital mixing system to handle a globally popular production, which previously needed two mixing surfaces.p>

            <p>The production features more than 150 inputs, approximately 50 microphone inputs and 80 channels of playback, with around 500 cues. All inputs are digital - each microphone feed being converted from analogue at the wireless transmitter, with the audio processing fully digital until the sound leaves the amplifiers for the PA system. Previous productions of the play saw sound effects and music mixed on a Yamaha CL5 digital console, with the cast microphones mixed on a separate console.</p>
                
            <p> Key to the new production was the RIVAGE PM series’ advanced theatre software, which offers a number of advantages to theatre sound designers.</p>
                
            <p>“The RIVAGE PM5 combines the features we liked about both previous consoles. One is the benefit of running it in dual monitor mode,” says Gareth. “It means the SFX operator can use the left fader bank of the control surface and the microphone mixer can use the rest. It made for a much simpler overall signal flow and we were also able to reduce our seat kill considerably.”</p>    
                
            <p>The rear panel of the HS3 and HS4 is equipped with combination XLR/TRS phone, RCA, and stereo mini connectors, allowing you to connect to a wide range of professional and consumer equipment such as computers, audio interfaces, audio mixers, and electric instruments. The most commonly used features—power button, volume knob, and headphone connector—are located in the front for easy access.</p>    
                
            <p>The compact size of the HS3 and HS4 was made possible thanks to the highly efficient class-D amp. Using one amp for two speakers has enabled us to both reduce the weight of the speakers and simplify the cable connections. They take up little space even in a small bedroom studio, and are easy to take with you on the road </p>    
                
            <p>“We are pleased to announce the addition of a new model to the HS series,” says Yoshiyuki Tsugawa, Senior General Manager at Yamaha Creator & Consumer Audio Division. “We look forward to supporting the creative work of more people than ever before by offering even more ways to use the HS Series' renowned high sound quality in a compact chassis.”</p>

            <p>The A/B switching is another indispensable feature. The principal cast members all have two wireless transmitter frequencies. If one has problems, the A/B instantly switches to the other. On this production, some cast members dive into water while wearing microphones, so issues occur quite often.</p>

            <p>One of the big challenges of a complex sound system that uses networked audio is that the physical network connections have no relationship to how audio is flowing between multiple devices, so you can’t tell what is going on by looking at how a system is physically connected together any more. Communicating that in itself is tricky, let alone when everything needs to be translated into a different language. I wrote a 112 page document to explain how the show goes together and how the various audio and control systems work together to help the Japanese team understand what was going on within the system.</p>
